// You must create a function that takes in a flight path of a rocket ship as a string of letters and 
// returns the following format: "{x: X, y: Y, direction: 'DIRECTION'}"
// X,Y represent the ending coordinates of your ship and direction represents its final direction.

// Your ship simulator must take in a string of letters that represent a planned flight path for a given rocket ship.
// In a shipâ€™s flight path there are only 3 valid options for movement: 
// R for turning right, L for turning left and A for advancing.

// Orientation is represented as left, right, up or down.
// Space is infinite, so the x,y coordinates you return could be placed on a seemingly infinite 
// grid and can be negative or positive values.

// right = +1
// left = -1
// advance = =1 OR -1
